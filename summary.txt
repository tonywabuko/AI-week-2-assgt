🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Using Machine Learning
SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being

📌 Problem Addressed
This project contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by analyzing healthcare data to uncover patterns in:
- Patient demographics
- Medical conditions
- Healthcare costs

The insights aim to enhance resource allocation, preventive care planning, and patient outcome optimization.

🤖 Machine Learning Approach
Algorithm:
- K-means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

Features Used:
- Age
- Billing Amount
- Medical Condition

Preprocessing Steps:
- StandardScaler for numerical features
- LabelEncoder for categorical variables

Configuration:
- Number of clusters: 4
- Random state: 42

📈 Results
Patient Segmentation:
- Successfully segmented patients into 4 distinct clusters
- Each cluster represents unique age-cost-medical condition combinations

Key Findings:
- Age and Billing Amount are major contributors to clustering
- Medical conditions vary significantly across age groups
- Some clusters show notably higher healthcare costs

⚖️ Ethical Considerations
Data Privacy:
- Patient data must be anonymized
- Ensure secure handling and storage of sensitive information
- Comply with healthcare data protection laws

Fairness and Bias:
- Avoid healthcare discrimination based on clustering
- Watch for bias in age-based groupings
- Regular audits of the clustering logic are essential

Implementation Concerns:
- ML results are decision-support tools, not clinical replacements
- Human oversight in healthcare remains vital
- Continuous validation and retraining of the model is needed

💡 Recommendations
- Use clustering insights to optimize resource allocation
- Create targeted preventive care initiatives
- Monitor cost patterns across age and condition groups
- Update models regularly with new healthcare data
- Promote transparency in AI-aided medical decisions
